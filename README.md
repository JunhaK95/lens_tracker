I am using this to learn more about Rust.

A simple app that helps me track my contact lense usage.

They last 30 days and I struggle to remember how many days I have used them.

TODO:
 * Add better data persistence. At the moment we just write a JSON locally, something like SQLite would probably be better no?
 * Create API layer
 * Add Telegram integration.
 * Better user interactions. At the moment a new lens is considered fresh out the box. We should allow older lenses to be loaded as well.
